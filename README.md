# **Titanic Survival Prediction Project**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and with this project, we aim to explore the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. By examining various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and embarkation port, we aim to gain insights into the factors contributing to survival.

## **Technologies Used**

Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.

Libraries: Utilized various Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model implementation.

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes attributes such as PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked.

## **Project Overview**
### **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and encoded categorical variables.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed statistical measures and visualized data to understand the distribution of survivors.

### **Model Building**: Implemented logistic regression for binary classification.

### **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy score on training and testing datasets.
